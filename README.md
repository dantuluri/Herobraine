The experiment will be broken into a series of phases in which a new
agent (so to speak) is introduced to one contiguous narrative. Technically
we will maintain a Minecraft server (version 1.12.2) and let
these agents interact with the server and others as they learn according
to the human examples we provide. There really isn't a goal here, we just 
want to see what the hell you do when you stress tess these agents. We'd be
really happy to see the community contribute other agents to the narrative,
but for now we're attempting to stress test the standard set of algorithms.
